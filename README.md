 We created a Python script that uses the YOLOv5s model with PyTorch to test how quickly it can detect objects. Instead of using real images, we simulated a few with random data to see how fast the model runs. This helps us understand if YOLOv5 is fast enough for real-time use in robotics or self-driving vehicles
