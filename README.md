Project Title: Real-Time Object Detection for Autonomous Vehicles and Robotics

Project Description:

This project leverages the YOLOv5 deep learning model to enable real-time object detection for autonomous vehicles and robotic systems. The aim is to provide situational awareness by identifying and localizing objects such as pedestrians, vehicles, road signs, and obstacles in the environment. The system uses a pretrained YOLOv5s model from Ultralytics, optimized for speed and efficiency, making it suitable for real-time deployment on edge devices.

A simulated test environment feeds synthetic image data into the model to evaluate inference performance. The project records and analyzes the average inference time, ensuring the model meets latency requirements for real-world robotic applications.

By integrating object detection into autonomous systems, the project contributes to safer navigation, obstacle avoidance, and intelligent decision-making in dynamic environments.

Key Features:

Real-time object detection using YOLOv5

Evaluation of inference speed on simulated data

Scalable to various platforms including drones, delivery bots, and self-driving cars

Foundation for further development with real-world datasets and sensor inputs
